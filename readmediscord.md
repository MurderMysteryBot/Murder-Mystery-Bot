From FireMario211;

  If you're wondering why I am not responding to any messages or really anything, it's because of something that happened to my account.
My account recently (as of 6/3/2019) got disabled due to me being involved in "selling, promoting, or distributing cheats, hacks, or cracked accounts.".

  However I have not done any of those or was involved in any of those, what I think the reason that my account was disabled was because of my staff member (not on MMB but another server) was giving away
compromised accounts, however when I found out about that, I've told them to cancel the giveaways, tell what happened and warned them.

  If that's not the reason then i'm unsure of why my account was disabled.
  
  It may take days, weeks, or even months for my account to be reinstated. I'll still try to work on MMB and my other bots, but I cannot test if there
are any bugs in the bot due to me not being able to test the bot.

  So that's why I am unable to communicate with anyone on discord, I hope that I'm able to get my account reinstated as I have important servers that i've joined and important servers that I own, and things I keep on discord that I do not want to lose.

I hope that i'll be able to be back on discord. I have a lot of friends, bots, and servers and would hate to lose all of that, all because of something that I didn't do.

If one of my friends are reading this, **I'm sorry.**
