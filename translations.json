However, the **Detective** can search and find who the Murderer is then shoot them, or the **Jailor** can jail the murderer to find out no one has been murdered, and finally if you try to attack someone while they were in jail, the **Jailor** will find out exactly who tried to attack the person who was jailed and the person will be notified but not know who attacked. If you are the **Murderer**, be careful of who you try to kill. If someone asks for your role, try claiming that you are **Innocent**, or if someone is dead, try making sure people forget that person died and if someone asks for your role, say that you are that role. I would not advice claiming as a **Radio Person** as people will say to broadcast something to prove that you are, if either the **Jailor** is dead or the **Detective** is dead and everyone forgot, that they were dead, then if you claim that, everyone may listen to you as they are the most important roles. The **Murderer** also has a partner which is the **Assassin**, only the **Murderer** can assign targets for the **Assassin** who will try their best to get them killed. The **Assassin** does not know who the **Murderer** is and the **Murderer** cannot kill any of their partners.",

If they attempt to search someone while they are in jail, they will not be able to search them since the person who the **Detective** is attempting to search is in jail.\n\nThe third role is the **Healer**, which can resurrect people if they were killed, murdered, shot, etc. However they cannot attempt to heal people in jail. The **Healer** is also a target for **Evils** as of now, the **Healer** can heal anyone without any limit, which can frustrate the **Murderer** or any evil roles.\n\nThe fourth role is the **Radio Person** who can broadcast anything anonymously at night.",

The **Assassin** also cannot be killed by the **Murderer** as they are partners.\n\nThe sixth role is **Jailor**, which can jail people to interrogate them, if someone is jailed, they cannot use any role commands, this makes it convenient for the **Jailor** to see if anyone murders, or the **Murderer** can bait the **Jailor** to execute the person by not killing at all. The **Jailor** can decide if the person that they jailed should be executed or not, executing will reveal what their role was in the public chat and (not a feature yet) if they execute someone who was **Innocent** or wasn't evil, will not be able to execute anyone, but they can still jail people.",

If the **Healer** does heal the person in time, they will not be turned into a **Zombie**, however if the person who was infected turns into a **Zombie**, their role will be revealed in the private zombie chat and they will not be able to use their normal role commands again, besides using the zombie role commands.
